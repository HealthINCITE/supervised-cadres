# supervised-cadres
Python code implementing the supervised cadre method for supervised learning.

This supervised cadre method is for regression problems in which the population under study may be softly partitioned into a set of cadres. The cadres create clusters of observations based on only a few predictive features. Within these cadres, the behavior of the target variable is more simply modeled than it is on the population as a whole. We introduce a discriminative model that, when trained on a set of observations, simultaneously learns cadre assignment and target prediction rules. Our formulation allows sparse priors to be put on the model parameters. These priors allow for independent feature selection processes to be performed during both the cadre assignment and target prediction processes, which results in simple and interpretable ensemble models. Models are learned using adaptive stepsize stochastic gradient descent.
